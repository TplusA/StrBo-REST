2021-06-29  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 0.15 released.

	* USB: Add flag "flaky_uuid" to devices and partitions to mark bad
	  UUIDs.

2021-06-28  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 0.14 released.

	* Updates: Fix system if recovery data partition found to be broken.

2021-06-01  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 0.13 released.

	* USB: Enable browsing of USB devices, and playing files from them.

	* API: Fix event reporting using JSON objects over WebSocket.

	* Airable: Fix event reporting on login status change.

2021-03-19  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 0.12 released.

	* Updates: Updated monitoring of UpdaTA v0.5. This was necessary to
	  avoid abortion of the update process

2021-03-10  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 0.11 released.

	* Updates: Error propagation and proper use of HTTP status codes in
	  update and recovery endpoints.

	* Updates: Catch download failures and handle them properly.

2020-11-02  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 0.10 released.

	* Network: Fix read-out of network configuration.

2020-08-05  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 0.9 released.

	* Updates: Increase timeouts for UpdaTA wrappers. Planning phase takes
	  around 30 seconds on CM1, so 15 seconds was way too short. Timeouts
	  for both, planning and execution phases, have been significantly
	  increased to take very slow network connections (as per year 2020
	  standards) into account.

	* Helpers: Fix killing of helpers which take too long time to
	  complete. We must use sudo in this case because the helpers are
	  started with sudo as well.

2020-08-04  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 0.8 released.

	* System management: Add endpoints for managing T+A HiFi system
	  components, including per-device version information and update
	  facilities.

	* Updates: Software update requests can be POSTed to Streaming Board
	  system component. This facility is used by dcpd v5.8 and later, but
	  it is open and may later be used by our app or some web frontend.

	  This part relies on UpdaTA, the T+A system updater. The REST API
	  provides a wrapper and monitoring around the updater, the actual
	  work is done by UpdaTA itself.

	* API: Reply with specific error JSON objects on errors, try to get
	  error reporting done the right way everywhere.

	* General: Reestablished compatibility with Python 3.4 for V1
	  Streaming Board releases.

	* Misc: Catch all uncaught exceptions raise in the core and turn them
	  into JSON error objects including a trace to the location of error.
	  This is going to be helpful for debugging.

	* Misc: Many bugfixes.

2020-05-22  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 0.7 released.

	* Recovery: Added endpoints for managing the recovery system. We can
	  now exchange and verify the recovery system, i.e., the boot
	  partition of the recovery system. In addition, we can also ask the
	  system to reboot to enter the recovery system.

	* Misc: More work on porting to Yocto Project "dunfell" (paths, gpg2,
	  public key management).

	* Misc: Several style fixes.

2020-05-07  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 0.6 released.

	* General: Depend on Werkzeug 1.0.1.

	* Misc: Use PyGObject instead of ctypes to tap into GLib. This finally
	  works in Yocto Project "dunfell".

	* Licensing: Changed license from GPLv3+ to GPLv2+.

2019-06-04  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 0.5 released.

	* API: Fix parsing of Content-Type header.

2019-02-06  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 0.4 released.

	* Network: Configuration requests sent to service endpoints do not
	  require the "wlan_info" field anymore (implementation matches the
	  documentation now).

2019-01-21  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 0.3 released.

	* Network: Return information about whether or not the services and
	  NICs are cached (generally, all WLAN service information will be
	  cached while in access point mode).

2018-10-10  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 0.2 released.

	* Network: Enabled reading out and writing back network configuration
	  data. The corresponding endpoints communicate with dcpd (version
	  4.16 or above is required). Update notifications are not implemented
	  yet.

	* Caching: Support ETag headers.

	* Misc: Fix versioning.

	* Misc: Various clean-ups and improvements all over the place.
